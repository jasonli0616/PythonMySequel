#### Note:
In most of this getting started guide, we will be using and referring to the [`Connection`](api_reference/connection.md#connection) object, which works for MySQL.\
SQLite databases require the [`Connection`](api_reference/connection.md#sqlite_connection) object instead.\
Most of the syntax is the same, and we will explicitly specify when it is different.
